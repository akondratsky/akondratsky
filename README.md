Hi, I’m @akondratsky or just Alex K.

I am frontend developer with a psychological education, slightly fullstack on background;

I’m interested in automated learning systems, knowledge management and many other things, I dream about the time when machine will make human smarter;

I’m currently learning everything what can be useful for my goal: fundamentals of graph databases, message queueing, microservice architecture... etc.

I’m looking to collaborate on my passion. I need to share and discuss ideas and I need help in my search and struggling with different technologies.

Feel free to follow me if you are really interested in mentioned topics and if you want me to share my contacts with you.
